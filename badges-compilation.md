## Reflections

1. <details><summary>Getting Started with TypeScript</summary><br>After going through the 'Get started with TypeScript' module I gained a solid understanding of why TypeScript is considered an improvement over JavaScript. The module walked me through the process of installing TypeScript and setting up a project in VS Code.<br><br>The concept of static typing, a key feature of TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, resulting in creating more reliable and maintainable code. The experience of setting up a TypeScript project in VS Code gave me a practical understanding of the TypeScript development workflow and compilation process.<br><br>Understanding the benefits of TypeScript has influenced my decisions for future web development projects. If I were to work on a large-scale web application, TypeScript's static typing feature would be useful in maintaining code quality and scalability.<br><br></details>

2. <details><summary>Declare Variable Types in TypeScript</summary><br>This module deepened my understanding of TypeScript by teaching me how to declare variables using different types. I learned about the benefits of declaring typed variables in TypeScript, as well as how to declare variables using primitive types, object types, and even advanced types like union and intersection types.<br><br>Understanding how to declare variables using different types in TypeScript allows me to write more readable and error-free code. For example, using union types can help me work with functions that can take multiple types of arguments, which increase the flexibility of code. Using intersection types can help me combine multiple types into one, which can be useful in scenarios where an entity can have characteristics of multiple types.<br><br></details>

3. <details><summary>Implement Interfaces in TypeScript</summary><br>With the module 'Implement interfaces in TypeScript' I delved into the concept of interfaces, which is not present in JavaScript, but is fundamental to TypeScript and object-oriented programming n general. I learned how to declare, instantiate and extend interfaces, as well as how to declare interfaces with custom array types.<br><br>Interfaces not only help in defining the shape of complex objects but also ensure that the objects follow a certain structure. This gave me a deeper understanding of the robustness and flexibility of TypeScript.<br><br>The ability to use interfaces opens up new possibilities in my development work. When working with complex data structures, interfaces can help enforce a particular structure, reducing the likelihood of errors. Furthermore, the ability to extend interfaces allows to reuse code and improve organization in large projects.<br><br></details>

4. <details><summary>Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript</summary><br>The 'Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript' module was a valuable addition to my TypeScript knowledge. It expanded my understanding of functions in TypeScript, showed me the benefits of using types in functions and taught me how to write functions with different parameters. I also learned to define function types using type aliases or interfaces.<br><br>The use of types in functions improves code readability and maintainability, and the flexibility of having required, optional, default, and rest parameters in functions allows for more robust function definitions. The ability to define function types using type aliases or interfaces provides a clear and concise way to specify the function signature.<br><br>The skills gained from this module are directly applicable to real-world programming scenarios. For example, optional parameters can make a function more versatile, while default parameters can provide defaults when no argument is provided. Defining function types using type aliases or interfaces can help ensure that functions adhere to a specific signature, reducing potential errors.<br><br></details>

5. <details><summary>Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript</summary><br>In the module 'Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript' I learned how TypeScript extends ES6 functionality by adding access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. I also improved my knowledge of how to declare, instantiate and extend classes, learned to apply access modifiers, define static properties. A significant part was understanding how interfaces are used with classes to ensure class instance shape.<br><br>Understanding how to work with classes in TypeScript is a fundamental skill for any TypeScript developer. The ability to extend classes and ensure class shape using interfaces provides a solid foundation for building complex applications. For example, when working on a large-scale project, using classes and interfaces to structure the code can greatly improve readability and maintainability. Understanding of how interfaces are used with classes will be particularly useful for ensuring the consistency in the structure of objects in my code.<br><br></details>

6. <details><summary>Generics in TypeScript</summary><br>Despite the complexity of the topic, I was able to grasp the concept of generics, which are code templates that can be defined and reused throughout the codebase. I learned to identify use cases for generics, define a generic function, declare a generic interface and class, and use generic constraints.<br><br>Generics enable type safety while maintaining flexibility by allowing functions, classes, or interfaces to handle different types and still providing type checking.<br><br>In real programming scenarios the ability to use generics allows writing more flexible and reusable code. A generic function can handle different types, reducing code duplication. Generic interfaces and classes can be used in a similar way for the same reasons. Implementing generic constraints allows for better control over the types that a generic can work with, ensuring type safety.<br><br></details>
