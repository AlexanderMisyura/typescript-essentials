# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/alexandermisyura/achievements/yv8c6kxr) / [Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-get-started/)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/alexandermisyura/achievements/9n5b5hsu) / [Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-declare-variable-types/)
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/alexandermisyura/achievements/pt2yqle4) / [Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-implement-interfaces/)
## Reflections

1. <details><summary>Getting Started with TypeScript</summary><br>After going through the 'Get started with TypeScript' module I gained a solid understanding of why TypeScript is considered an improvement over JavaScript. The module walked me through the process of installing TypeScript and setting up a project in VS Code.<br><br>The concept of static typing, a key feature of TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, resulting in creating more reliable and maintainable code. The experience of setting up a TypeScript project in VS Code gave me a practical understanding of the TypeScript development workflow and compilation process.<br><br>Understanding the benefits of TypeScript has influenced my decisions for future web development projects. If I were to work on a large-scale web application, TypeScript's static typing feature would be useful in maintaining code quality and scalability.<br><br></details>

2. <details><summary>Declare Variable Types in TypeScript</summary><br>This module deepened my understanding of TypeScript by teaching me how to declare variables using different types. I learned about the benefits of declaring typed variables in TypeScript, as well as how to declare variables using primitive types, object types, and even advanced types like union and intersection types.<br><br>Understanding how to declare variables using different types in TypeScript allows me to write more readable and error-free code. For example, using union types can help me work with functions that can take multiple types of arguments, which increase the flexibility of code. Using intersection types can help me combine multiple types into one, which can be useful in scenarios where an entity can have characteristics of multiple types.<br><br></details>

3. <details><summary>Implement Interfaces in TypeScript</summary><br>With the module 'Implement interfaces in TypeScript' I delved into the concept of interfaces, which is not present in JavaScript, but is fundamental to TypeScript and object-oriented programming n general. I learned how to declare, instantiate and extend interfaces, as well as how to declare interfaces with custom array types.<br><br>Interfaces not only help in defining the shape of complex objects but also ensure that the objects follow a certain structure. This gave me a deeper understanding of the robustness and flexibility of TypeScript.<br><br>The ability to use interfaces opens up new possibilities in my development work. When working with complex data structures, interfaces can help enforce a particular structure, reducing the likelihood of errors. Furthermore, the ability to extend interfaces allows to reuse code and improve organization in large projects.<br><br></details>
